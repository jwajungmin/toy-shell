This code is compiled in WSL2 (Ubuntu).

It is in Script language and C language.

You can see with this program User and Host name, Hello world, clock, cwd, CLA, DISK condition,
and some of command, exit, name function.

Firstable, you have to type "gcc shell.c", "gcc -o shell shell.c " and "bash toyshell" for start shell. Then you can see Hello world, clock,
cwd, DISK condition. But if you want to command line argument in start page, you should type 
bash shell and more words like "bash shell a b c d".

After that, there will be "MyShell $". You can type there some command like /bin/ls, then you
can see argv, argc, envp, and contents by command.

Also you can see username and hostname by typing "name", and in the same way you can quit
the shell by typing "exit".

Thank you!
